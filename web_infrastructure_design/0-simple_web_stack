### Explanation
A user types www.foobar.com in their browser. The domain name resolves via DNS (A record) to the server IP 8.8.8.8.  
The request reaches the server, which contains:
- **Web server (Nginx):** handles HTTP requests and serves static files.
- **Application server:** runs the application logic.
- **Application files:** the code base.
- **Database (MySQL):** stores user and application data.

The server communicates with the userâ€™s computer using the HTTP protocol.

**Issues:**
- Single Point of Failure (if the server goes down, everything is unavailable).
- Downtime during maintenance (restarting, deploying new code).
- Cannot scale with high traffic.
